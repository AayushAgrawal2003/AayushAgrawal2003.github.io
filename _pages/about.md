Welcome to the personal website of **Aayush Agrawal**, a robotics enthusiast, researcher, and aspiring academic. I specialize in autonomous systems, surgical robotics, and path planning for dynamic environments. This site serves as a platform to showcase my research, publications, projects, and other professional achievements.

A Data-Driven Personal Website
======
This website is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), a free service that automatically builds and hosts websites from a GitHub repository. The template enables academics like me to present our work through structured markdown files that are converted into static HTML pages.

### My Research Interests:
- **Autonomous Systems:** Developing robust and deployable solutions for dynamic environments, with a focus on affordability for developing nations.
- **Surgical Robotics:** Exploring minimally invasive techniques using cutting-edge technologies like diffusion policies and soft robotics.
- **Vision-Based Models:** Creating affordable solutions for path planning and perception in complex scenarios.

### Featured Achievements:
- Led **Team Abhiyaan**, the autonomous robotics team at IIT Madras, to win **first place** in the Design and Cyber Challenges at **IGVC 2023**.
- Submitted a paper on an **Ultrasound-Guided Robotic System for Autonomous Percutaneous Intervention** to **ICRA 2025**.
- Developed the **Lane Occlusion Inpainting and Detection (LOID)** algorithm, leading to a submission to **AAAI 2025**.
- Worked on **Level 5 autonomy** for institute shuttles at IIT Madras and presented my work at the **IIT Madras Research Conclave** in 2023 and 2024.

Getting Started
======
If you're an aspiring academic or robotics enthusiast interested in creating a personal website, this template makes it easy to separate content from design. Markdown files store content and metadata, while the siteâ€™s theme converts them into HTML. Each update to the GitHub repository automatically refreshes the live website.
