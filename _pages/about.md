Welcome to my academic website, powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). This site showcases my journey as a robotics researcher and engineer, with details about my publications, projects, and academic achievements.

A Robotics Journey Inspired by Real-World Challenges
======
I am Aayush Agrawal, a robotics enthusiast and researcher, currently pursuing my passion for creating innovative solutions in robotics. My journey is fueled by a vision to address day-to-day problems through robust and affordable robotic systems, particularly in dynamic environments like Indian roads and the medical domain.

### Highlights of My Work
- **Autonomous Systems:** Developed and tested Level 5 autonomous institute shuttle systems (Bolt) and proposed affordable vision-based solutions tailored for Indian roads.
- **Surgical Robotics:** Worked on Ultrasound-Guided Robotic Systems, tumor detection, 3D modeling, and ATIR for organ mapping, contributing to a paper submitted to ICRA 2025.
- **Simulation and Testing:** Innovated hyper-realistic simulation methods using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian splatting models, leading to collaborative research projects.

My primary focus lies in bridging the gap between theoretical research and deployable robotics solutions, making a positive impact on lives through technology.
