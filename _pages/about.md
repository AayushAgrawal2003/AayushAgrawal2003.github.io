I am Aayush Agrawal, a robotics researcher and engineer, currently pursuing my **Master of Science in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD) at Carnegie Mellon University**. My work focuses on creating deployable, robust robotic systems with applications in autonomous vehicles, aerial robotics, and surgical robotics.

### Highlights of My Work
- **Autonomous Systems:** Co-led the development of **Bolt**, a Level 5 autonomous institute shuttle at IIT Madras, integrating in-house drive-by-wire, sensor fusion, and autonomy algorithms. Developed **LOID (Lane Occlusion Inpainting and Detection)**, improving lane detection accuracy by ~22% over state-of-the-art baselines.
- **Aerial Robotics & Drones:** As Co-founder and Lead Roboticist at **TelebortiX**, spearheaded the development of one of the largest L5 autonomous **QuadPlane VTOL systems** for middle-mile logistics, integrating AI-based control stacks, GPS-denied navigation, and custom perception modules. Raised **$500,000 pre-seed funding** (patent filing ongoing).
- **Medical Robotics:** Worked on **Ultrasound-Guided Robotic Systems** for autonomous percutaneous interventions, involving 3D organ mapping (ATIR), tumor detection, and clustering pipelines. Research led to a publication on **arXiv (2024)** and a paper submission to **ICRA 2025**.
- **Simulation & Testing:** Advanced semantic mapping and simulation by extending frameworks such as **Rayfronts (IROS’25)** with hierarchical clustering–based compression, achieving **95% data compression with 13% semantic distortion**. Proposed Augmented Reality extensions for bridging hyper-realistic simulation with real-world testing.

### Key Research Themes
- **Perception & Path Planning for Robotics:** Swarm navigation systems with reinforcement learning for task allocation, semantic SLAM with LLM-based natural language querying, and robust algorithms for real-world autonomy.
- **Medical & Soft Robotics:** Exploring minimally invasive surgery through autonomous systems and diffusion policies for surgical applications.
- **Simulation & Systems Engineering:** Building scalable frameworks for efficient testing, bridging the sim-to-real gap for autonomous systems.

### Selected Publications
- **Syn2Real Domain Generalization for Underwater Mine-like Object Detection** – IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 2025.  
- **Preliminary Evaluation of an Ultrasound-Guided Robotic System for Autonomous Percutaneous Intervention** – arXiv:2410.10299, 2024.  
- **LOID: Lane Occlusion Inpainting and Detection for Enhanced Autonomous Driving Systems** – arXiv:2408.09117, accepted at *Machine Vision and Applications*.  

### Honors
- **K. C. Mahindra Scholarship** for Post-Graduate Studies Abroad (2025).  
- **Best Design & Cybersecurity Report**, IGVC 2023.  
- **National Chess Tournament (7th Place, India, 2017)** – CBSE.
