title: "Syn2Real Domain Generalization for Underwater Mine-like Object Detection Using Side-Scan Sonar"
excerpt: "This work introduces a domain generalization approach for detecting underwater mine-like objects using side-scan sonar imagery. By bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world datasets, the method enhances detection accuracy for critical underwater applications.<br/><img src='images/MLO.drawio3.png' width='500'><img src='images/SSS.png' width='500'>"
