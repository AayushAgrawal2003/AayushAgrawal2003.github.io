title: "Syn2Real Domain Generalization for Underwater Mine-like Object Detection Using Side-Scan Sonar."
excerpt: "Worked on a Mine Like Object detection approach for underwater submarines on a project in collaboration with Naval Science and Technology Laboratory of DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organization). Developed a domain generalization approach using side scan sonar images and diâ†µusion models to address
the scarcity of data for underwater object detection, achieving a 60% improvement in mAP.<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
