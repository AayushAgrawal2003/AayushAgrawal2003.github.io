This work addresses the challenge of underwater mine-like object detection by introducing a Syn2Real domain generalization approach. Utilizing diffusion models and synthetic-to-real transfer techniques, the study overcomes the scarcity of labeled sonar data, achieving a 60% improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP). The method effectively bridges the domain gap between synthetic and real-world sonar images, enhancing the reliability of underwater object detection systems. Developed under the guidance of Prof. Suresh Sundaram at IISc Bangalore's Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Laboratory, this research represents a significant step toward safer and more effective underwater exploration.
