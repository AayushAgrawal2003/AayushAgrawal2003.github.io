This paper presents a novel approach to developing a robotic system for ultrasound-guided autonomous percutaneous interventions. The research focuses on creating data pipelines between devices, developing 3D reconstruction algorithms for human modeling, and implementing tumor detection and clustering techniques. A significant contribution of the study is the introduction of the ATIR (Atlas-based Transformation and Iterative Registration) method, which enables the alignment of CT maps with human point clouds for accurate 3D organ mapping. The work showcases robust experimental validations and potential applications in minimally invasive medical procedures.
