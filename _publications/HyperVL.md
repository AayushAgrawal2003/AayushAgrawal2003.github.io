HyperVL Sim is a next-generation simulation platform designed for testing and validating autonomous driving systems. By incorporating Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting, the system achieves unparalleled realism in replicating complex driving scenarios. The platform enables hardware-in-the-loop testing and introduces a novel Augmented Reality extension, bridging the gap between simulation and real-world testing. This work represents a collaborative effort between IISc Bangalore, Wipro, and IIT Madras, showcasing advancements in sim-to-real transfer for autonomous systems.
